
The following commands will install the gpsd client and the 
gps pluggin for python. 

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps

With the gps unit plugged in, typing the following:
> sudo lsusb
you should see an output similar to the following:
 Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp.
 Bus 001 Device 004: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port
 Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9512 Standard Microsystems Corp.
 Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

The Prolific Technology entry corresponds to the G-Star IV gps unit. 
It should create a USB port such as /dev/ttyUSB0, although the number
may be different if you have multiple USB devices connected to the Pi. 

Start the gps daemon by typing: 
> sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

Now typing the following should give you a gps display:
> cgps -s

Make sure your gps unit has a clear view of the sky. If testing indoors
it should work if it's on a window sill.
