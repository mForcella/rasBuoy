<h2>rasBuoy: Creating a mesh sensor network using Raspberry Pi and XBee radio modules</h2>

This project was created by Michael Forcella with assistance from David Richardson (SUNY New Paltz, biology department) and Chirakkal Easwaran (SUNY New Paltz, computer science department) in 2017. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a framework for an affordable mesh sensor network. This would allow for the deployment of many sensors within a lake, or other environment, for a reasonable cost. Deploying numerous sensors throughout a lake environment is particularly important given the spatial variability of most waterbodies. 

If you are interested in building your own sensor network I would encourage you to read through the pdf document, 'Creating.a.mesh.sensor.network.' Instructions can be found in Appendix A of the document. 

Please note, there was not sufficient funding at the time to see this project through to completion, so the hardware used in the project was not actually sufficient for a successful deployment. If you plan on deploying this network you will want to use a larger solar array and a larger capacity battery. There are also other suggestions for reducing power consumption, such as replacing end nodes with Arduino units, rather than Raspberry Pi.
